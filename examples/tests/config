# config
# Cloud Haskell config file.
# Most Cloud Haskell applications will look for this file
# in the current directory, although it's ultimately up
# to the programmer which filename to use or if to
# use a config file at all. You may override
# the default location with the RH_CONFIG
# environment variable.
# All the options given in this file may
# also be given on the command line of a
# Cloud Haskell application. Options on the
# command line override options in a config
# file. For example, to set the role of an
# application, use the following command
# line:
#      ./MyApp -cfgRole=MASTER
#
#   This is a reasonable default config file.

# The role of a node determines its initial behavior.
# Typical roles including MASTER or WORKER. Typically,
# when starting an application, this value must be
# specified, either here or on the command line.
# Default: NODE
cfgRole NODE

# If specified, this option will override the
# default assignment of host name, which forms
# port of all node IDs and process IDs originating
# on this node.
### cfgHostName somehostname

# If nonzero, will force the node to listen for
# new incoming connections on a specific port.
# Otherwise, the port is assigned by the OS.
# Default: 0
cfgListenPort 0

# This is the UDP port on which local network
# broadcasts are sent to discover peers.
# If 0, no dynamic peer discovery is performed.
# This value must be the same for all nodes
# that want to participate in dynamic discovery
# with each other.
# Default: 38813
cfgPeerDiscoveryPort 38813

# A unique token that nodes exchange when they
# communicate. The intent is to prevent different
# applications on the same network from mixing
# up their nodes. This value must be the same
# for all nodes that want to communicate with each
# other.
# Default: MAGIC
cfgNetworkMagic MAGIC

# Specifies the port where the node registration
# server will bind. This value must be the same
# for all nodes that want to communicate with each
# other.
# Default: 38813
cfgLocalRegistryListenPort 38813

# A list of hosts where nodes will be searched for.
# All hosts that you wish to communicate with should
# be included in this list. By host name, we mean
# the DNS name or IP address of a computer accessible
# over the network interface where a node registry
# may be running. Hostnames are separate by spaces.
### cfgKnownHosts somehostname anotherhostname thirdhostname

# The maximum delay, in microseconds, to tolerate
# delays from service services. In an extremely congested
# network atmosphere, you may want to increase this.
# If 0, applications waiting for dead services
# may wait indefinitely.
# Default: 10000000
cfgRoundtripTimeout 10000000

# The maximum number of concurrent outgoing TCP
# connections (for sending messages) from this node.
# If outgoing message density is higher than this
# number, some processes will block.
# Default: 50
cfgMaxOutgoing 50

# Relates to the task layer only. The amount of
# time, in microseconds, to wait for an unused
# promise to flush to a disk file. Flushing is good,
# because it frees up memory for other data, but
# if this value is too low, heavy disk access
# may slow down your program. If 0, promises
# are never flush to disk.
# Default: 5000000
cfgPromiseFlushDelay 5000000

# Relates to the task layer only. The prefix
# of the files to be written when they
# are flushed. May contain a full path.
# Default: rpromise-
cfgPromisePrefix rpromise-
